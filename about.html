          Hello world!
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Ben, and I'm a Software Developer looking to sharpen my
          skills. I chose to make my blog about video games because I love them,
          although to be honest I don't spend too much time playing them.
        </p>

        <p>
          I hope you enjoy looking over my submission for this project! I know
          there's always a ton of learn so I'm eager to hear what you think!
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm including all the links you can reach me at down below, feel free
          to say hello!
        </p>
